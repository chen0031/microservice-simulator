== Context
This system makes it easy to simulate a solution comprised of many microservices, allowing the testing of the operational aspects of the system, such as the information provided by distributed tracing or the scheduler's ability to self-heal.  The project provides the scripts and containers needed to create the system, either locally or in the Amazon cloud.  The project is meant to be a standalone experiment and does not fit into any existing production environments.

== Functional Overview
The system is conceptually very simple.  A simulated client will introduce a request into the system, asking for a "question" to be answered.  The request enters into the system and cascades throughout the back end containers  eventually returning the result back to the client.  The client can make requests either through messaging or REST, allowing us to test the two forms of communication.  A very simple control plane is used to alter the behavior of the various containers as the system runs, such as introducing latency or failing health checks, allowing the Operator to run a variety of tests.  The payloads, as they traverse the system, are constructed in such a way so as to provide a "trail" of how the services had to be coordinated in order to fulfill the request.  The Operator has the option of constructing either a wide, shallow system or a narrow, deep one, observing how differently the system behaves with each configuration.

== Quality Attributes
The latency and throughput values are controlled by Operator, depending on the experiment being run.  Delays can be introduced into the containers to increase latency.  The Operator also has the option of using sequential or parallel communication algorithms to affect throughput.  Scalability and availability can be controlled by the Operator via the container scheduler being used.  To keep the implementation simple, no security protocols are part of the simulation.  When running in the Amazon cloud, native AWS monitoring and tracing solutions are used.  When running in a development environment, open source equivalents are used.

== External Interfaces
. What are the key external interfaces?

.. publicly exposed APIs
.. exported files
. Has each interface been thought about from a technical perspective?
.. what is the technical definition of an interface?
.. if messaging is being used, which queues and topics are components using to communicate?
.. what format are the messages (e.g. plain text, Avro, JSON)?
.. are they synchronous or asynchronous?
.. are asynchronous messaging links guaranteed?
.. are subscribers durable where necessary?
.. can messages be received out of order and is this a problem?
.. are interfaces idempotent?
.. is the interface always available or do you need the cache data locally?
.. how is performance/security/etc catered for?
. Has each interface been thought about from a non-technical perspective?
.. who has ownership of the interface?
.. how often does the interface change and how is versioning handled?
.. are there service-level agreements in place?
. A paragraph on each interface covering this topics is sufficient

.Dynamic Routing Logic
We need a mechanism that allows the Operator to configure different message routes using the same set of components so different system tests can be performed.  The *Routing Slip* pattern, in combination with AMQP's Headers Exchange, is a good fit for this problem.  https://www.cloudamqp.com/blog/2015-09-03-part4-rabbitmq-for-beginners-exchanges-routing-keys-bindings.html[Headers Exchange] is used to route messages to the proper consumers based on the values of AMQP headers.

. Headers Used For Routing
. *Message Type* -- can be either *Command* or *Event*
. *Subject* -- the *what* or *whom* the message is about, e.g. *user* or *authenticator*
. *Verb* -- in the case of a Command, what we want the Subject to do.  In the case of an Event, what the Subject has done. For example, *authenticate* or *authenticated*.

These headers are filled in whenever a message is sent to the Headers Exchange, which routes the message to any interested parties.  Once the message arrives at its destination, the consumer needs to know what to do with the message.  That is where the Routing Slip comes into play.  Each message payload contains a routing slip section which contains a list of message coordinates (header values) that need to be emitted.

.Optional Routing Slip Section
[source,JSON]
----
{
    "routing-slip":
    [
        {
            "type": "command",
            "subject": "user",
            "verb": "authenticate"
        },
        {
            "type": "event",
            "subject": "user",
            "verb": "failed authentication"
        },
        {
            "type": "command",
            "subject": "images",
            "verb": "fetch"
        },
        {
            "type": "event",
            "subject": "images",
            "verb": "fetched"
        }
    ]
}
----

In the above example, there are four messages described in the sequence.  The consumer will emit an event to the coordinates described in the first item in the list,  The remaining 3 items are placed in the message payload for the next consumer to process.  This is repeated until the routing slip list is empty.
